# AssessEEZ Production Deployment Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue: Static Files Not Found

Your production deployment is failing because static files (images) are not being found. This is a common Django production issue.

## 🔍 Root Cause

- **Production Mode**: `DEBUG=False` in production
- **Missing Static Files**: `/app/staticfiles/` directory doesn't exist
- **WhiteNoise Configuration**: Not properly configured for production

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Production Settings File
Created `AssessEEZ/production_settings.py` with:
- Proper static files configuration
- WhiteNoise middleware setup
- Production security settings

### 2. Updated WSGI Configuration
Modified `AssessEEZ/wsgi.py` to use production settings

### 3. Enhanced Build Script
Updated `build.sh` to:
- Use production settings
- Collect static files properly
- Verify static file collection

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix production static files configuration"
git push origin master
```

### 2. Redeploy Your Application
The build script will now:
- Create `/app/staticfiles/` directory
- Collect all static files from your project
- Configure WhiteNoise properly

### 3. Verify Static Files
After deployment, check logs for:
```
Production settings loaded - STATIC_ROOT: /app/staticfiles
Created STATIC_ROOT directory: /app/staticfiles
SUCCESS: Static files collected successfully
```

## 📁 What Gets Collected

The `collectstatic` command will copy:
- `static/` folder contents → `staticfiles/`
- `static/images/` → `staticfiles/images/`
- All CSS, JS, and image files

## 🔧 Manual Fix (if needed)

If automatic collection fails, you can manually run:
```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=AssessEEZ.production_settings
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

## 📊 Expected Result

After deployment:
- ✅ No more "Not Found: /static/images/..." errors
- ✅ All images display correctly
- ✅ Smooth mobile navbar animations work
- ✅ Professional responsive design

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check deployment logs for build script output
2. Verify `staticfiles/` directory exists in production
3. Ensure WhiteNoise middleware is loaded
4. Check that `STATIC_ROOT` is properly set
