Important Note:
    Do not chnage the logic or backend files. I need to only work on the Frontend ui design of the project templates files.
    Redesign the templates files without changing the logics and the color schemes of the files. Add some dynamic animations to the different parts of the pages and make it more appealing.

Key Features Section
• Admin Capabilities
Admins are the backbone of any assessment process. With AssessEEZ, admins can effortlessly create and
manage qualifications, drawing from an existing list or crafting new ones to meet specific needs. This feature
also allows for the seamless assignment of users to these qualifications, ensuring that assessors, IQAs, EQAs,
and learners are all aligned and informed. Furthermore, admins can upload list required documents on a per-
qualification basis, guaranteeing that no document is missed to ensure adherence to the stringent
requirements of awarding bodies.

• Learner Experience
The learner's journey is at the heart of AssessEEZ. Upon logging in, learners are greeted by a personalized
dashboard that offers a clear overview of their assigned qualifications and progress. This centralized hub also
facilitates direct communication with both admins and assessors, ensuring that queries are addressed promptly.
Learners can then engage with the streamlined submission process, uploading evidence against specific
assessment criteria with ease and tracking the status of their submissions in real-time.

• Assessor Tools
Assessors play a pivotal role in the assessment process, and AssessEEZ is designed to make their job more
efficient. With our platform, assessors can view all assigned qualifications and learner lists in one place,
alongside access to pertinent resource materials and IQA reports. This holistic view enables assessors to provide
more informed feedback. The platform also supports the efficient review of learner submissions and
documents, with the ability to offer actionable feedback for improvement. Real-time updates and customizable
notifications keep assessors abreast of all developments.

• IQA Oversight
Internal Quality Assurance is paramount for maintaining the integrity of the assessment process. AssessEEZ
empowers IQAs with the tools to review and provide feedback on assessor decisions, ensuring a layer of quality
control. Additionally, IQAs can upload reports for both assessors and learners, with the flexibility to control
visibility as needed. This oversight not only enhances transparency but also contributes to the continuous
improvement of the assessment process.
